# AMD_Intermediate_Language_Assembler
An assembler for AMD's Intermediate Language for shader applications.

The reason for the creation of this tool was the removal of the ability to compile DirectX HLSL shaders to AMD Intermediate Language binaries that can be used in Mantle to run Graphic Applications. AMD's CODEXL shader analyzer had this functionality removed, so I had to compare the documentation for the AMD Intermediate Language against the resulting Intermediate Language Binary from different ripped shaders and Alexander Overvoorde's Hello Triangle shaders. Some assumptions had to be made, as a minor inconsistency was found in the documentation against numerous ripped shaders towards the AMD Intermediate Language Opcode enumeration array, but the region for the estimate was narrowed down to within a Â±00.7% margin of error. Although this error can ultimately crash any application, there are suitable workarounds to avoid it. Any input on where a crash may can lead to a correct assumption on where a complete enumerated list for instructions can be acheived.
